// My sql

1. use HAVING with only GROUP BY. Don't Use it instead of WHERE clause
   DON'T DO THIS : SELECT cust_id FROM customer HAVING surname="Kelvin";
         DO THIS : SELECT cust_id FROM customer WHERE  surname="Kelvin";
   
   Reason : HAVING clause is very slow .   

2. If you want to use WHERE , HAVING , ORDER BY , GROUP By in a single query then order should be
  WHERE     : it will pick appropriate rows
  GROUP BY  : it will grouping rows by appliying condition in HAVING clause
  HAVING    : 
  ORDER BY  : At last it will sort grouped rows
  
  Exa:
    SELECT city,surname,firstname,count(*) 
    FROM customer
    WHERE state="ABC"
    GROUP BY surname,firstname HAVING count(*)>2
    ORDER BY city;
